      <h3>What Is IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)?</h3>
      <ul>
      <p> The International Phonetic Alphabet is a set of characters used to represent the pronunciation of letters and words in any langauge. There are different models of documentation for IPA, but this is one of the most common representations of how IPA works in American English:</p>

      </ul>
      <p> As accents change over time, new documentation for IPA must be created. It is important to note that this example of IPA sounds in American English are based on the most "moderate" accent in American English, which comes from Ohio. This chart fails to be accurate if you wish to learn pronunciation of American English from places like Massachusetts, Texas, or California.

      <h3>How To Use IPA</h3>
      <ul>
      <p>To use IPA, refer to the chart on how how certain symbols relate to sounds presented in the example words. Each symbol corresponds with the sound from the underlined part of a word. You can also use the symbol categories to reference the kinds of sounds being made:</p>
      <ul>
        <p> -A monophthong is a sound that has one quality, the shape of your mouth does not change throughout making the sound.</p>
        <p> -A dipthong is a sound that has two qualities, the shape of your mouth changes in order to complete the whole sound. </p>
        <p> -A voiced sound is one you use your vocal chords to make. All vowels in American English are voiced, along with most consonants. </p>
        <p> -An unvoiced sound is one you do not use your vocal chords to make. These sounds depend solely on your lips, teeth and tongue to be made, like "ch" in "cheese".
